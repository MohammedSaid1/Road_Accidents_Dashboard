## Tableau Dashboard: Accident Analysis

### Overview

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard designed to analyze and visualize accident data over a specific period. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of accident severity, conditions during the accident, and more.

### Dataset

The primary dataset used for this dashboard is `accident data.csv`. Here's a brief overview of the key columns:

- **Index**: Unique identifier for each accident.
- **Accident_Severity**: Severity of the accident (e.g., Serious, Slight).
- **Accident Date**: Date of the accident.
- **Latitude & Longitude**: Geographical coordinates of the accident.
- **Light_Conditions**: Lighting conditions during the accident.
- **District Area**: District of the accident location.
- **Number_of_Casualties**: Number of casualties resulting from the accident.
- **Number_of_Vehicles**: Number of vehicles involved in the accident.
- **Road_Surface_Conditions**: Condition of the road.
- **Road_Type**: Type of road (e.g., Single carriageway).
- **Urban_or_Rural_Area**: Classification of the accident location (Urban/Rural).
- **Weather_Conditions**: Weather at the time of the accident.
- **Vehicle_Type**: Type of primary vehicle involved.

### Dashboard Features

The Tableau dashboard (`Accidents Project.twb`) provides the following insights:

1. **Accident Severity Overview**: A breakdown of accidents by their severity.
2. **Geographical Heatmap**: A heatmap showcasing accident-prone regions.
3. **Accident Trends Over Time**: A timeline showing the frequency of accidents.
4. **Accident Conditions**: Visualizations related to light, road, and weather conditions during accidents.
5. **Casualty and Vehicle Analysis**: Insights into the number of casualties and vehicles involved in the accidents.

(Note: The above features are based on assumptions. Users should refer to the actual Tableau dashboard for precise insights.)
